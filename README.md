# Welcome
## To a simple NodeJS Guide
Let me guide you how to use this repository. 
### What's it for?
> This repository was made while I was understanding the basic concepts of NodeJS and creating a tool for others to quickly revise these concepts.

The repository is divided into sections which are listed below:

#
`A comprehensive list of HTTP Status Codes is present in the root folder. You can use it for reference :D `
#
### Basics and Introduction
> This includes, as you might have guessed it, content related to basics of NodeJS.
```
A comprehensive JS refresher with focus on components required for NodeJS is also included here, you may go through it if you want a quick recap of JS as a language. Basic JS language is expected however.

`I will keep on updating this README file as I continue learning myself.`
